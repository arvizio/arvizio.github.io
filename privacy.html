<p style="text-align: center;">Arvizio Immerse 3D Privacy Policy</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The Arvizio Immerse 3D Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Arvizio&rsquo;s software platform and applications. Arvizio Inc. Is a Canadian corporation based in Ottawa, governed by the laws of Canada and the laws of Ontario.</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>This policy applies to the Arvizio Immerse 3D software platform including Immerse 3D applications, Arvizio Director application and Arvizio Cloud Services.</p>
<p>The Arvizio Immerse 3D solution provides 3D collaboration software to enterprise customers including video, audio and mixed and augmented reality sharing capabilities.</p>
<p>Arvizio&rsquo;s software does not collect or store any personal information as our customers deploy and run Arvizio Director and Immerse 3D application software using their own on-prem infrastructure. The Arvizio Cloud Service does not store customer data and only relays session data between devices over encrypted links.</p>
<p>The following description provides information regarding how Immerse 3D software utilizes audio and video capabilities of XR devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>No recordings of audio are made by Arvizio and the XR device microphone is used only for real-time group collaboration sessions within the application. Arvizio Inc. &nbsp;and its employees and contractors do not have the ability to listen to the user&rsquo;s audio unless they join a network session as a visible and named participant. If a user does not wish to have their audio transmitted in a network session, the user can enable the in-app mute feature or elect not to join a network session.</li>
<li>No recording of video by Arvizio is made on the XR device cameras; the user explicitly records for their own use. Remote video capabilities are used only for real-time group collaboration sessions both locally and across multiple locations.&nbsp;Arvizio&rsquo;s employees and contractors do not have the ability to connect to the user&rsquo;s video feed unless they are invited to join the session as a visible and named participant.&nbsp; If needed, the user can block the video feed transmission and or disconnect from the session at any point of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Term</strong></p>
